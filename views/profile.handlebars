            'Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair
            (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and
            icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u
            don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I
            was because he’s a major ******* hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white.
            I have pale white skin. I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in
            England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell)
            nd I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today
            I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink
            fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner
            and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no
            sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.'
